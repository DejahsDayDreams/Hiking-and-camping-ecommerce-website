# Camping-and-hiking-website
Redisigning a camping and hiking website with a cart and wishlist, all products are on a database



In this exciting project phase, I'm pleased to be taking Camp & Climb's digital presence to the next level. 
We're starting with a template, and my job is to tailor it to their specific requirements.

Development:
My key goal during this phase is to make the website more engaging and interactive. 
I'll plan the layout, structure, and design meticulously to ensure it's consistent with Camp & Climb's corporate identity.
My goal is to design a website that is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and engaging for their visitors.

My journey starts with careful planning. I'll design thorough wireframes to show how each page will appear and work.
This phase is critical because it guarantees that Camp & Climb and I are on the same page about the structure and look of the website.
I'll begin the design step once I have a firm plan. I'll give the website a new and inviting look by using the colors from the Camp & Climb logo.
I'll use white space sparingly to achieve a clean, modern look.

I have great plans for functionality. I'll be using PHP to add additional features and capabilities to the website, improving its overall utility.
Customers will find it simpler to navigate the site, get information, and interact with it.

Performance Enhancement:
One essential issue I'll focus on is shortening the website's load time. 
This is critical because a speedier website gives a more seamless user experience. It means customers won't have to wait as long for pages to load, 
which will increase their pleasure and likelihood of purchasing. To accomplish this, I will optimize numerous elements such as graphics and scripts.

Design Flaws:
To prevent making the same mistakes as before, I will perform a thorough examination of the present website. 
This analysis will assist me in identifying design flaws, inconsistencies, or aspects that may have contributed to poor performance. 
By identifying these concerns, I can ensure that the replacement website does not have the same issues.
